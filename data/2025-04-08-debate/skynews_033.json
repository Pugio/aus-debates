    "Albanese: Well, Kieran, you can't control everything that happens, and we know in the world it's uncertain, but I'm absolutely certain of this: now is not the time to cut. Now is not the time to look backwards. Now is the time to look forward and seize the opportunities and build Australia's future.",
    "Moderator: Prime Minister, thank you. Mr. Dutton.",
    "Dutton: Thanks very much, Kieran. Thank you, Anthony, for being here tonight, and thank you very much to the audience. I think your stories tonight will reflect the realities and the stories of millions of Australians. And it has been a tough year, a tough three years, in fact, for Australians. People have seen the government make mistakes, starting with the Voice, and priorities that just haven't accorded with your own priorities. Almost 30,000 small businesses have gone broken, and behind each one of those stories, there is somebody who's lost their house or lost their life savings. People have gone backwards because when you go to the supermarket now, you're now paying 30% more for groceries, about 32% more for your electricity.",
    "Dutton: And the Prime Minister promised at one of these debates at the last election that your power bills would go down by $275. Instead, they're up by $1300. I want to provide support to Australians from the first day that we're elected. And that is through a 25-cent-a-liter cut to fuel, both diesel and unleaded. It'll help families. It'll help businesses. It'll help pensioners, and it will help the economy. In addition to that, we want to make sure that we can get gas for Australians so that we can fix up the energy system, which is driving up the cost of everything. And if we can do that, we can get our country back on track. That's a positive plan that I want to talk about and want to say thank you very much for being here tonight.",
    "Moderator: Mr. Dutton, thank you very much. We got our first question, Michael. Thanks, Michael.",
    "Michael: Thank you. Um, I've got a question to both, um, the Prime Minister and Mr. Dutton. We come out of COVID, and the economy did really well after that, and we're still going well at the moment. How are we going to cope with the Trump pandemic?"

  "segment_summary": "Following the previous segment, Dutton responds to Albanese by critiquing the government's performance, citing the Voice referendum, small business closures, and rising costs, especially electricity. He proposes a fuel excise cut as a solution. A question from a member of the people's forum then turns to how the candidates plan to manage the \"Trump pandemic\".",

    "conservative": "Dutton successfully contrasts the government's promises with the current economic reality, especially regarding energy costs. The fuel excise cut is a tangible policy that will resonate with everyday Australians, particularly those in rural areas or reliant on driving for work. Small business and general economic hardship will be good messages to gain votes.",
    "neutral": "Dutton presents a clear critique of the government's economic performance and offers a straightforward solution in the form of a fuel excise cut. The question from Michael regarding \"the Trump pandemic\" is ambiguous and will likely require clarification from the candidates before they are able to address the concern.",
    "progressive": "Dutton's statistics should be thoroughly investigated, particularly the claim about power bill increases. Claiming a fuel excise cut is the answer is short-sighted and environmentally irresponsible. The question about the \"Trump pandemic\" is vague and may reflect anxieties about social division and misinformation."
