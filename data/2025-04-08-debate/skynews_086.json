    "Albanese: Thanks very much. Uh, to put really clearly, uh, there were tax cuts legislated under the former government. They went primarily. I would have got $9,000, so would Peter. Instead, we got four and a half, and we gave it to everyone. By lowering that bottom marginal tax rate. Now what we've done is we'll lower it by a cent, and then a further cent, uh, over the next, uh, over the next term of government. Because we wanted to make sure that every Australian got a tax cut, and the way that you make sure that low and middle income earners benefit is to target that first marginal tax rate that kicks in, of course at $18,200 and goes up to $45,000.",
    "Moderator: Let's wrap up if we can. We're going to get them final statements in a moment, just a couple of quick answers if I can"
