    "Moderator: Let's wrap up if we can. We're going to get them final statements in a moment, just a couple of quick answers if I can.",
    "Dutton: Well, Kieran, a couple of points. Firstly, I think that was a very confronting scene, if I might say, from where we're standing. You see the number of hands raised then of people who are working hard, people who've done everything they can in their own budgets to cut back on expenses and just to try and make things balanced at the end of each week, at the end of each fortnight or month and, as I said in my opening remarks, I think it's reflective of the broader population in Australia at the moment and it's certainly similar to many of the conversations we've had as we've moved around the country.",
    "Dutton: People in tears are people who've taken their kids out of school. People who've stopped a doctor's appointment because they can't afford to pay to go to see the doctor under this government. Bulk billing rates have come down dramatically under this government. So, I, I think we should be doing everything we can to provide support, but we need to do it in a way that is not inflationary, because with 12 interest rate rises the worst thing that we can have is a big Labor Green spending government after the election because that will be, that will be upward pressure again on interest rates, which will be a disaster for families particularly with big mortgages.",
    "Moderator: Let's hear from our next voter, this is Hibba."
