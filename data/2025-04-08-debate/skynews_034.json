    "Michael: Thank you. Um, I've got a question to both, um, the Prime Minister and Mr. Dutton. We come out of COVID, and the economy did really well after that, and we're still going well at the moment. How are we going to cope with the Trump pandemic?",
    "Moderator: That's a very big question, indeed.",
    "Dutton: I didn't realise it was a pandemic, actually. I think the Prime Minister might want to take that one.",
    "Albanese: Well thanks very much Michael. And I think the important thing is that we stand up for our values. And one of the things that I found most disturbing about President Trump when he was in office was his attitude towards our alliances, his attitude towards NATO, his attitude towards the ANZUS alliance, his attitude towards Japan and South Korea.",
    "Albanese: We are much stronger when we work with our friends. One of the things that I'm proud of is that we've deepened our relationships in the Indo-Pacific. That's why the Quad is so important. That's why our relationship with Japan is so important. And that's why we need to continue to argue the case for a world based on the rule of law. Because if we don't do that, then the only alternative is a world based on the rule of might. And that's why it's important that we stand up for a world order."

    "conservative": "Albanese's comments reflect a traditional foreign policy perspective and an unease with a potential Trump presidency. His stance on alliances will likely resonate with voters who prioritize strong international partnerships.",
    "neutral": "Albanese responds to the question by addressing potential foreign policy challenges from a future Trump administration. His response highlights the importance of alliances and a rules-based international order. Dutton's initial remarks may be seen as dismissive and could alienate some voters.",
    "progressive": "Albanese's emphasis on international cooperation and a rules-based order aligns with progressive values. His implicit criticism of Trump's foreign policy is a welcome contrast to the potential for isolationism and unilateral action."
