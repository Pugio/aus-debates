    "Albanese: That's why my government has had to fight the 8 and a half billion dollars you've matched to be fair, you have said you agree with our policy there, but we're repairing what we inherited which was bulk billing in freefall while the coalition was in government.",
    "Dutton: Well again, that is factually incorrect. So I was Health Minister in 2013-2014, the bulk billing rate in our country was 84%. It went to 88% by the time we finished government and the Prime Minister rightfully will point out that that includes services over Covid. Uh but it was heading up under us.",
    "Dutton: The fact is that it is now down to 77%..",
    "Albanese: Did you try to introduce a charge to get rid of bulk billing?",
    "Dutton: I'm happy to come to that.. So it's now at 77%.",
    "Dutton: The Prime Minister wants you to believe that it's much higher and that it's in freefall, it's not. It wasn't in freefall under our government and what has happened since the Prime Minister's been in power over the last three years, it has come back. Now doctors that we put into-"
