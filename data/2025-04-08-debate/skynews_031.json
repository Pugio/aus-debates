    "Moderator: Inflation spikes since the 1980s and the biggest energy crisis since the 1970s.",
    "Albanese: But what matters is how you respond. And we've responded the Australian way. Thanks to the hard work of Australians including the people in this room, inflation is down to 2.4%. Wages are up, they've been up five quarters in a row, real wages. Unemployment is low at 4.1%. We've created 1 million jobs and importantly interest rates have started to fall. What this election is about though is what happens next. Whether we continue to build on those foundations with a tax cut for all 14 million Australians. Strengthening Medicare, including those bulk billing rates getting in up to 90% and making sure we have urgent care clinics. Free TAFE, the 20% of student debt and making more things here in Australia through a future made in Australia. Now"
