Now is not the time to look backwards. Now is the time to look forward and seize the opportunities and build Australia's future.",
    "Moderator: Prime Minister, thank you. Mr. Dutton.",
    "Dutton: Thanks very much, Kieran. Thank you, Anthony, for being here tonight, and thank you very much to the audience. I think your stories tonight will reflect the realities and the stories of millions of Australians. And it has been a tough year, a tough three years, in fact, for Australians. People have seen the government make mistakes, starting with the Voice, and priorities that just haven't accorded with your own priorities. Almost 30,000 small businesses have gone broken, and behind each one of those stories, there is somebody who's lost their house or lost their life savings. People have gone backwards because when you go to the supermarket now, you're now paying 30% more for groceries, about 32% more for your"

    "progressive": "Dutton's statistics need to be interrogated and given context. Claiming the Voice failure is due to the government is misleading - the proposal was carefully designed and subject to wide consultation. Small business failure claims should be carefully analyzed and weighed."
