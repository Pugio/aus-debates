    "Dutton: they want a house for themselves and their family as well and the government just hasn't been building the housing.",
    "Moderator: Jason, you happy with that? And if if you've got a question for the Prime Minister as well?",
    "Jason: I've got a follow-up question just in regards to part of Australia, our way of life is sharing our way of life with the rest of the world. So part of our humanity is doing good. And so us training other people from all around the world gives them an open opportunity to witness our Australianism. And so by not allowing those students to come to Australia, it actually hurts our brand worldwide.",
    "Moderator: We've we've had quite a. America. Thanks Jason.",
    "Moderator: we've had quite a few as you know Mr. Dutton. Foreign students become ministers Prime Ministers. It's it's a good soft power tool, isn't it?",
    "Dutton: look I I think we are not only the best country in the world but I think we've been made better because of our migration story. When you look at the migration.",
    "Albanese: Well, it's a matter of getting the sequencing right and also making sure that there's a supply of appropriately skilled labor. It's something that I discussed with president with president Jokowi and the new president with President Prabowo the enormous opportunities to bring people from our region to study here.",
    "Albanese: truth is, the population today is lower than what was anticipated in 2019 it was going to be. The migration levels fell in the last year by 31% in one level.",
    "Albanese: We introduced legislation to put a cap on student numbers. the coalition and the Greens voted against it in the Senate, so it couldn't get through. We want a reasonable cap that protects the universities because their funding levels is connected with this. that makes sure though that we get that balance right. And on housing, we've got a 33 billion dollar homes for Australia plan. that has seen in part. we have 28,000 social housing units either under construction or in planning as we speak, right today.",
    "Albanese: There's been 400,000 homes or units built",
    "Moderator: PM, on the the back of what Dutton says about the supply of international students and what that's doing to rents here.",
    "Hibba: I'm extremely worried and concerned about the funding of weaponry aiding the onslaught on the innocent people of Gaza. What are you doing to stop this Prime Minister and Opposition leader what will you do about this if you are elected?",
    "Moderator: Prime Minister first you.",
    "Albanese: Well, thank you very much for the question and I certainly understand that for many Australians of particularly those with families or relatives either in Israel or in Gaza or indeed in Lebanon this has been a very traumatic period.",
    "Albanese: My government's approach is that every innocent life matters and we want to see a ceasefire. We want to see hostages released. We want to see aid get through to Gaza. I must say though there are no Australian weaponry involved in what is going on in Gaza. that is just not the case. Uh we have made sure as well that Australia has taken I think a responsible position of continuing to call for not just the short-term issues in terms of",
    "Albanese: a ceasefire aid to people in Gaza the release of hostages, but also our principled stance of a two-state solution. I want to see both Israelis and Palestinians live in peace and security side by side.",
    "Moderator: Prime Minister, thank you. Mr. Dutton.",
    "Dutton: Well, like the Prime Minister and I'm sure like every Australian, I want to see peace in the Middle East as well. But what we saw when Hamas took hostages and took people into a tunnel network that was an action which if it had happened to Australians there would have been an expectation of our government to react to send in the SAS to make sure that we recovered those people as quickly as possible. And I want to make sure that in our country people can celebrate their heritage can celebrate their connections to a country of origin or to a country which is important to them. But when you come to our country, it's about celebrating being Australian. ",
    "Moderator: Let's hear from our next voter, this is Janine.",
    "Janine: I'm wanting to try and give the chance for more people here, but not from building new homes, buying property and building new homes. "
