    "Katie Allen: will give every Australian a new deal. Labour in the coalition want net zero. Zero jobs, zero prosperity and zero future. A vote for labour all the coalition is a vote to destroy your family and their livelihood and increase the cost of living. China has become a manufacturing superpower on the back of Australian iron ore and coal and its economy is one of the largest in the world. China has continued to build 750 coal fired power stations to dominate markets in Europe, the US with Australian iron ore and coal. Australia has a trillion dollars of debt. China imports 80% of its iron ore from Australia which has made it the world's biggest manufacturer dominating markets in Europe, the US and the rest of the world all on Australian iron ore. China can't buy it from anywhere else. With a 15% export license fee on iron ore exports we can pay off our debt. Do you want the Chinese to pay off our debt or you and your family. We can keep Medicare.",
