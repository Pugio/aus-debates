    "Michael: Thank you. Um, I've got a question to both, um, the Prime Minister and Mr. Dutton. We come out of COVID, and the economy did really well after that, and we're still going well at the moment. How are we going to cope with the Trump pandemic?",
    "Moderator: That's a very big question, indeed.",
    "Dutton: I didn't realise it was a pandemic, actually. I think the Prime Minister might want to take that one.",
    "Albanese: Well thanks very much Michael. And I think the important thing is that we stand up for our values. And one of the things that I found most disturbing about President Trump when he was in office was his attitude towards our alliances, his attitude towards NATO, his attitude towards the ANZUS alliance, his attitude towards Japan and South Korea.",
    "Albanese: We are much stronger when we work with our friends. One of the things that I'm proud of is that we've deepened our relationships in the Indo-Pacific. That's why the Quad is so important. That's why our relationship with Japan is so important. And that's why we need to continue to argue the case for a world based on the rule of law. Because if we don't do that, then the only alternative is a world based on the rule of might. And that's why it's important that we stand up for a world order.",
    "Albanese: Australia got the best deal of any country on the planet. Ten per cent is ten per cent more than we would like, but no one got a better deal than us, in part because of the representations that we made. But we were prepared as well. No country is better positioned to take advantage of the trade opportunities. It's important to remember this: eighty per cent of global trade doesn't involve the United States. In our region in particular, there will be opportunities for Australia that we want to seize.",
    "Albanese: We've said we'll have global trade missions following the missions that I've led to Indonesia, to India and China, looking for opportunities for businesses. We'll create a fund through our National Reconstruction Fund of a billion dollars to help businesses adjust here. We'll continue to negotiate of course with the United States, looking for a better deal for Australia because reciprocal tariffs would of course be zero, because we don't impose tariffs.",
    "Moderator: Mr. Dutton?"
  ],
  "segment_summary": "Continuing from the previous segment and a question from the audience, Dutton responds to Albanese by critiquing the government's performance. Michael, a member of the people's forum, then turns to how the candidates plan to manage the \"Trump pandemic\". Albanese responds that standing up for values and alliances is the important thing to do, especially in the Indo-Pacific. He argues for a world based on the rule of law. He then emphasizes that Australia got the best deal of any country on the planet on trade opportunities and the government is well prepared. Albanese emphasizes continuing to negotiate with the United States looking for a better deal for Australia. The Moderator then asks Mr. Dutton for a response.",

  "perspective_commentary": {
    "conservative": "Albanese's comments reflect a traditional foreign policy perspective and an unease with a potential Trump presidency. His stance on alliances and securing trade opportunities will likely resonate with voters who prioritize strong international partnerships. The national reconstruction fund is another good selling point.",
    "neutral": "Albanese responds to the question by addressing potential foreign policy challenges from a future Trump administration. His response highlights the importance of alliances and a rules-based international order. Dutton's initial remarks may be seen as dismissive and could alienate some voters. Albanese successfully conveys the importance of looking for global trade deals outside of the U.S.",
    "progressive": "Albanese's emphasis on international cooperation and a rules-based order aligns with progressive values. His implicit criticism of Trump's foreign policy is a welcome contrast to the potential for isolationism and unilateral action. Australia focusing on global trade deals as well conveys a global outlook and not just relying on the U.S."
