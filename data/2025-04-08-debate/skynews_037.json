    "Woman: Um, I work for the Department of Education and I've seen that there's quite a big difference between public versus private. I was wondering if we're getting any sort of funding towards public education in the near future.",
    "Moderator: Might go uh Mr. Dutton, kick that one off.",
    "Dutton: Well, I think it's an incredibly important question and it's important because parents have a choice to make and whether that's for the public system or for the private system, we have supported both and we support increased funding going into this election as well and there's a position which is identical between the two parties in relation to funding for public schools and for private schools as well. Uh I think it is important that parents are able to have that choice and that we can fund the infrastructure and that we can support teacher development and make sure that we've got an education system which is fit for purpose. We live in an incredibly competitive environment and we need to make sure that the outcomes in our schools are meeting the standards and expectations."

    "conservative": "Dutton's answer will reassure voters that the Coalition supports both public and private education, acknowledging parental choice. Emphasizing 'fit for purpose' could signal a focus on practical skills development to enhance competitiveness.",
    "neutral": "Dutton's response is a broad commitment to supporting both public and private education. He avoids making specific promises, instead highlighting the need for infrastructure and teacher development. The emphasis on competitiveness indicates a focus on educational outcomes that prepare students for the workforce.",
    "progressive": "The lack of specific commitment to increased funding for public education may concern progressives, particularly given perceived disparities. The emphasis on 'fit for purpose' could be interpreted as prioritizing vocational training over broader educational goals."
