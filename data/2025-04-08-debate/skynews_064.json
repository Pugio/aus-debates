    "Dutton: I can't achieve net zero by 2050 without cutting down on the approval times for small modular reactors and nuclear in those systems.",

    "Dutton: If the renewables are so much cheaper as the Prime Minister keeps telling you, why has he broken his promise of a $275 a year cut to your electricity bill, when in actual fact it's gone up by $1300 under this government and families are struggling to pay their bills.",
    "Dutton: The difference between the two policies is that our policy is 44% cheaper and in the interim, we increase the supply of gas into the market because"

  "segment_summary": "Dutton states that nuclear energy is the answer. He claims that they are paying 3 times the cost of energy compared to countries that have nuclear systems like Ontario. He then asks the voters why is the current government has broken their promise and now they are paying $1300 more. Dutton then claims that their new policy is 44% cheaper.",
