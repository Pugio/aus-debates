    "Albanese: things that are permanent.",
    "Albanese: So, our tax cuts will be permanent. Free TAFE will be permanent. Taking 20% off student debt will be permanent. The reduction reducing of medicines down to $25, the same cost that they were in 2004 will be a long-term difference. And we've frozen the cost for pensioners to just $7.70 for the rest of the decade.",
    "Albanese: So we understand cost-of-living pressures. That's why we've introduced as well energy rebates. All of these measures we've done, cheaper childcare. But all of them have been opposed by the Coalition. We have put in place what we can to make a positive difference. We know that there's more to do and that's why we want to do it.",
    "Moderator: Mr. Dutton, I'll ask you the same question but the other way around. You announced the reduction in the fuel excise. Why not do the tax cuts as well? That's what people expect of Liberal Party leaders, isn't it?",
    "Dutton: Well, Kieran a couple of points. Firstly"
