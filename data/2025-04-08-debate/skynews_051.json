    "Albanese: Well, thank you very much for the question and I certainly understand that for many Australians of particularly those with families or relatives either in Israel or in Gaza or indeed in Lebanon this has been a very traumatic period.",
    "Albanese: My government's approach is that every innocent life matters and we want to see a ceasefire. We want to see hostages released. We want to see aid get through to Gaza. I must say though there are no Australian weaponry involved in what is going on in Gaza. that is just not the case. Uh we have made sure as well that Australia has taken I think a responsible position of continuing to call for not just the short-term issues in terms of",

    "Moderator: Prime Minister, thank you. Mr. Dutton.",
    "Dutton: Well, like the Prime Minister and I'm sure like every Australian, I want to see peace in the Middle East as well. But what we saw when Hamas took hostages and took people into a tunnel network that was an action which if it had happened to Australians there would have been an expectation of our government to react to send in the SAS to make sure that we recovered those people as quickly as possible. And I want to make sure that in our country people can celebrate their heritage can celebrate their connections to a country of origin or to a country which is important to them. But when you come to our country, it's about celebrating being Australian. "
