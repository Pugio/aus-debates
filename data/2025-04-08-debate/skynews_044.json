    "Jason: I've got a follow-up question just in regards to part of Australia, our way of life is sharing our way of life with the rest of the world. So part of our humanity is doing good. And so us training other people from all around the world gives them an open opportunity to witness our Australianism. And so by not allowing those students to come to Australia, it actually hurts our brand worldwide.",
    "Moderator: We've we've had quite a. America. Thanks Jason.",
    "Moderator: we've had quite a few as you know Mr. Dutton. Foreign students become ministers Prime Ministers. It's it's a good soft power tool, isn't it?",
    "Dutton: look I I think we are not only the best country in the world but I think we've been made better because of our migration story. When you look at the migration.",
    "Albanese: Well, it's a matter of getting the sequencing right and also making sure that there's a supply of appropriately skilled labor. It's something that I discussed with president with president Jokowi and the new president with President Prabowo the enormous opportunities to bring people from our region to study here."
