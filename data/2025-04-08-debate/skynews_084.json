    "Dutton: So what we've said is that if there is an arrangement that you've got in your workplace with your boss and you can work from home or whatever the flexible arrangements are, that's fantastic. That's a decision between you and your employer in your workplace. Uh and there's no issue, we've never had any issue with that whatsoever.",
    "Dutton: Our argument in relation to Canberra was that we wanted to make sure and we do want to make sure uh that taxpayers who are working hard providing their taxes to the Commonwealth government that that money is being spent in the most efficient way.",
    "Dutton: The government's increased the public service in Canberra by about 20% and we want to make sure uh that we have flexible arrangements in place, that's fine. Uh and we've made that clear, um hopefully that stops the lies from being told.",
